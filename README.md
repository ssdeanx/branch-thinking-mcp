> ‚ö°Ô∏è **Branch-based thought navigation, cross-referencing, and AI-powered task/insight management for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.**

## üìù Summary

**Branch-Thinking MCP Tool** is an advanced agentic platform for managing, visualizing, and reasoning over branching thoughts, tasks, code, and knowledge. It empowers both AI agents and humans to organize complex projects, cross-link ideas, and automate insight generation using a powerful branch-based paradigm. With semantic search, visualization, and persistent task/code management, it is designed for next-generation collaborative and autonomous workflows.

## üß† How It Works

1. **Agents or users submit "thoughts"** (ideas, tasks, notes, code, etc.) to the tool, specifying a branch or letting the tool auto-create one.
2. **Each thought is scored** (semantic centrality, recency, diversity, confidence, key points).
3. **Thoughts are automatically cross-referenced** using semantic similarity (multi-hop up to 3 levels), with links scored and typed (e.g., "very similar", "related").
4. **Branches** represent parallel lines of reasoning, sub-tasks, or research threads. You can focus, switch, or summarize any branch.
5. **AI generates insights, summaries, and suggestions** for each branch, based on your evolving knowledge graph.
6. **Tasks** are persistent and can be managed, queried, and updated via commands.
7. **Code snippets** can be saved, tagged, and searched for reuse.
8. **Visualization** commands generate a graph of branches, cross-references, and hub thoughts for easy navigation.

### üîé Example Workflow

```json
{
  "content": "Refactor the API for clarity",
  "branchId": "dev"
}
```

- `list` ‚Äî See all branches
- `focus dev` ‚Äî Switch to "dev" branch
- `insights dev` ‚Äî Get AI insights for "dev"
- `link-thoughts thought-1 thought-2 supports "Thought 1 supports Thought 2"`
- `visualize dev` ‚Äî Visualize connections in "dev"

### üßë‚Äçüíª Advanced Usage Scenarios

- **Brainstorming:** Add multiple thoughts in batch to quickly capture a meeting or ideation session.
- **Research:** Use semantic search and cross-refs to surface relevant prior work, related ideas, or code.
- **Project Management:** Track tasks, update statuses, and summarize progress by branch.
- **Code Documentation:** Use doc-thought and summarize-branch to generate documentation and overviews.

---

## üí° Best Practices & AI Agent Guidance

- **Decompose complex goals** into sequences of thought/task/insight commands.
- **Iterate and adapt:** Use feedback from summaries, reviews, and visualizations to refine next actions.
- **Explicitly specify parameters** (branchId, status, assignee, etc.) for precise results.
- **Use batch mode** for efficiency when adding multiple thoughts or tasks.
- **Regularly review hub thoughts and AI insights** to discover non-obvious connections.
- **Use cross-references and multi-hop links** to foster creativity and bridge ideas.
- **Prompt agents** (Claude, GPT-4, etc.) to "think step by step" or "use chain of thought" for best results.

## üß™ Testing & Quality

- Run all tests: `pnpm test`
- Lint code: `pnpm lint`
- Type-check: `pnpm build`
- Advanced config: Edit `src/branchManager.ts` for scoring/AI logic

---

## üîê Security & Privacy

- All persistent data is stored locally (default: project directory or `MCP_STORAGE_PATH`)
- No external API calls unless configured
- Agents/users are responsible for privacy of stored thoughts and tasks
- See CONTRIBUTING for responsible disclosure

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Advanced Configuration

- **Tool not responding?** Check your MCP server logs and ensure the tool is listed in `claude_desktop_config.json`.
- **Persistent storage issues?** Ensure the server has write access to its working directory.
- **Customizing scoring/AI?** Edit `src/branchManager.ts` for advanced algorithms and heuristics.
- **Want to add new commands?** Extend `handleCommand` in `src/index.ts`.

---
