## Why Branch-Thinking?

- **Agentic by Design:** Built for both human and AI workflows‚Äîevery command is agent-friendly.
- **True Branching:** Organize, cross-link, and reason over ideas, code, and tasks in parallel.
- **AI-Native:** Semantic search, auto-summarization, and insight generation out-of-the-box.
- **Persistent & Visual:** Never lose a thought‚Äîeverything is queryable, visualizable, and extensible.

## Summary

> **Branch-Thinking MCP Tool** is an advanced agentic platform for managing, visualizing, and reasoning over branching thoughts, tasks, code, and knowledge. It empowers both AI agents and humans to organize complex projects, cross-link ideas, and automate insight generation using a powerful branch-based paradigm. With semantic search, visualization, and persistent task/code management, it is designed for next-generation collaborative and autonomous workflows.

## Quick Start

Get up and running in seconds:

```bash
pnpm install  # Recommended for speed (or npm install)
pnpm build
node dist/index.js --help  # See available commands
```

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/branch-thinking-mcp.git
cd branch-thinking-mcp
pnpm install  # Or npm install
pnpm build   # Or npm run build
```

### 2. Configure (Optional)

For Claude Desktop integration, add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
"branch-thinking": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": [
    "/your-custom-mcp-dir-here/branch-thinking/dist/index.js"
  ]
}
```

### 3. Run

```bash
node dist/index.js
```

---

## Real-World Usage Recipes

### 1. Knowledge Capture & Linking

```bash
# Batch capture meeting notes
add-thought dev "Discussed semantic search improvements" note
add-thought dev "Agreed to refactor API" decision
# Link related thoughts
link-thoughts t1 t2 supports "API refactor supports search improvements"
```

### 2. Agentic Task Extraction

```bash
# Extract and manage tasks from a research branch
extract-tasks research
list-tasks research open
update-task-status task-1 in_progress
```

### 3. Visualization for Insight

```bash
# Generate and interpret a knowledge graph
visualize dev
# Review AI-generated summary
summarize-branch dev
```

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Live Example: Agentic Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create a new branch for your project or idea
create-branch "AI Research"

# 2. Add thoughts and observations
add-thought [branchId] "Explore semantic search for agent workflows" analysis
add-thought [branchId] "Test cross-linking and summarization" observation

# 3. Link related thoughts
link-thoughts [thoughtId1] [thoughtId2] supports "Thought 2 validates Thought 1"

# 4. See your knowledge graph
visualize [branchId]

# 5. Extract tasks and get AI review
extract-tasks [branchId]
review-branch [branchId]
```

> Replace `[branchId]` and `[thoughtIdX]` with actual IDs from `list` and `history`.

## Best Practices

- Always start with `create-branch` to ensure clean context.
- Use `list` and `focus` to navigate between projects or lines of thought.
- Leverage `summarize-branch` and `insights` after adding several thoughts to get AI-generated context.
- Use `link-thoughts` to explicitly connect ideas, tasks, or code for richer semantic graphs.
- After code changes, always run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm build` to catch errors early.
- Decompose complex goals into sequences of thought/task/insight commands.
- Iterate and adapt: Use feedback from summaries, reviews, and visualizations to refine next actions.
- Explicitly specify parameters (branchId, status, assignee, etc.) for precise results.
- Use cross-references and multi-hop links to foster creativity and bridge ideas.
- Prompt agents (Claude, GPT-4, etc.) to "think step by step" or "use chain of thought" for best results.

## Security

- All persistent data is stored locally (default: project directory or `MCP_STORAGE_PATH`)
- No external API calls unless configured
- Agents/users are responsible for privacy of stored thoughts and tasks
- To report security issues, please [open an issue](https://github.com/your-org/branch-thinking-mcp/issues) or email the maintainer.

## Troubleshooting and FAQ

**Q: The tool isn't responding!**
A: Check the MCP server logs and ensure configuration is correct.

**Q: How do I reset storage?**
A: Delete or move the persistent storage directory (see config).

**Q: How do I add a new command?**
A: Extend `handleCommand` in `src/index.ts` and document it in the README.
